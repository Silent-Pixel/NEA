//one of the following algorithms will be used (multiple could be made to compare how they perform):
//- Dijkstra
//- A*
//- Breadth/depth searches (prob not)

//objective:
//draw a simple path from monster to player to visualise its path
//once visual path is working and can go around obstacles implement player movement
//if all working on one screen get monster to change its current screen by comparing its current location to the players and finding the shortest path to that screen
